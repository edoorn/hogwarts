## Tickets:
- HOG-1: Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in Gryffindor Tower. Use your text editor to add some text to their files that describes what they're doing or saying. 
- HOG-2: Neville Longbottom has entered Gryffindor Tower. Use the `touch` command in Terminal to create a .txt file called `neville.txt`. Use your text editor to add a text description or quote to this file.
- HOG-3: The Forbidden Forest is full of creatures, many of whom have names. Use the `mv` command in Terminal to rename these creature files: change `centaur.txt` to `firenze.txt`, and `giant_spider.txt` to `aragog.txt`.
- HOG-4: Use the `mkdir` command to create a Ravenclaw Tower directory inside of the `towers` directory. Name it `ravenclaw_tower`. Use the `touch` command to add a file in `ravenclaw_tower` called `luna_lovegood.txt` and give it some text.
- HOG-5: Hagrid and Fang are out on the grounds. Use `mkdir` to create a directory called `hagrids_hut`. Use the `mv` command to move Hagrid and Fang inside of Hagrid's hut.
- HOG-6: Dementors are swarming over the Hogwarts grounds. Use the `cp` command to copy `dementor.txt` seven times inside the `grounds` directory. Add a numeral at the end of the name of each text file to make them unique: `dementor_1.txt`.
- HOG-7: More Dementors are coming, and this time they're inside the castle. Use the `cp` command from inside the `grounds` directory, and declare a different destination directory. Copy one inside the dungeons, and one inside the Great Hall.
- HOG-8: Dobby is a free elf. Use the `mv` command from inside the root of the project (top level directory) to move Dobby to the Great Hall. Move the file using just one command, and without changing your working directory.
- HOG-9: Create a new directory in the root of the project called `hogsmeade`. Fill it with new locations, characters, and creatures. Give each text file some descriptive text.
- HOG-10: Harry sneaks out of the castle to visit Hogsmeade in his invisibility cloak. Use the `mv` command to move Harry into the Hogsmeade directory, and rename the file `invisible_harry.txt`. Do this as a one-line command.
