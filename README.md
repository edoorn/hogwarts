## Tickets:
- HOG-1: Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in Gryffindor Tower. Use your text editor to add some text to their files that describes what they're doing or saying. 
- HOG-2: Neville Longbottom has entered Gryffindor Tower. Use the `touch` command in Terminal to create a .txt file called `neville.txt`. Use your text editor to add a text description or quote to this file.
- HOG-3: The Forbidden Forest is full of creatures, many of whom have names. Use the `mv` command in Terminal to rename these creature files: change `centaur.txt` to `firenze.txt`, and `giant_spider.txt` to `aragog.txt`.
- HOG-4: Use the `mkdir` command to create a Ravenclaw Tower directory inside of the `towers` directory. Name it `ravenclaw_tower`. Add a file in `ravenclaw_tower` called `luna_lovegood.txt` and give it some text.
- HOG-5: Hagrid and Fang are out on the grounds. Use `mkdir` to create a directory called `hagrids_hut`. Use the `mv` command to move Hagrid and Fang inside.
- HOG-6: Dementors are swarming over the Hogwarts grounds. Use the `cp` command to copy `dementor.txt` seven times inside the `grounds` directory. Add a numeral at the end of the name of each text file to make them unique: `dementor_1.txt`.
- HOG-7: More Dementors are coming, and this time they're inside the castle. Use the `cp` command from inside the `grounds` directory, and declare a different destination directory. Copy one inside the dungeons, and one inside the Great Hall.
